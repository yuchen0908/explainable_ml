# explainable_ml
* The objective is to practise techniques presented by [Interpretable Machine Learning by Christoph Molnar](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)
* Eventually, turning all the practise into a re-usable library

# Schedule / To-do list
1. stage 1 - basics
   - [x] s4.1 - Train the number of bikes for bike dataset (s4.1_bike_rental.ipynb, reusable function - plot_learning_curve())
   - [x] s4.3 - Train cancer classification
   - [x] s8.1 - Partial dependence plot
2. stage 2 - popular algorithms to explain models
   - [x] s8.2 - Accumulated Local Effects (ALE)
   - [ ] s8.5 - Permutation Feature Importance
   - [ ] s9.1 - Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE)
   - [ ] s9.2 - Local Surrogate (LIME)
3. stage 3 - cutting edge / Shapley related
   - [ ] s9.5 Shapley Values
   - [ ] s9.6 SHAP
4. stage 4 - other articles from chapter 8 and 9
   - [ ] s8.3 Feature Interaction
   - [ ] s8.4 Functional Decomposition
   - [ ] s8.6 Global Surrogate
   - [ ] s9.3 Counterfactual Explanations
   - [ ] s9.4 Scoped Rules
