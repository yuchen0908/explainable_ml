# explainable_ml
* The objective is to practise techniques presented by [Interpretable Machine Learning by Christoph Molnar](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)
* Eventually, turning all the practise into a re-usable library

# Schedule / To-do list
1. stage 1
   - [x] s4.1 - Train the number of bikes for bike dataset (s4.1_bike_rental.ipynb, reusable function - plot_learning_curve())
   - [x] s4.3 - Train cancer classification
   - [x] s8.1 - Partial dependence plot
2. stage 2
   - [x] s8.2 - Accumulated Local Effects
   - [ ] s8.3 - Feature Interaction
   - [ ] Functional Decomposition
