# explainable_ml
* The objective is to practise techniques presented by [Interpretable Machine Learning by Christoph Molnar](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/)
* Eventually, turning all the practise into a re-usable library

TO-DO list
1. we need to pre-train models. Train cancer probability for cancer dataset, and number of bikes for bike dataset

Some questions to answer:
1. ML covers a wide range of algorithms, regression, classification, clustering, anomaly detection, dimension reduction, recommendation, etc.. what do the techniques cover? what do not?
2. 

Environment setup
pip install -U -r requirements.txt
